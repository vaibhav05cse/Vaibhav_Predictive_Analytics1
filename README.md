Phase-1:
I have formulated the relationship between the value of SENSEX and the stock price of Infosys. This relationship has been formulated using a Simple Linear Regression Model implemented in Python. Through this relation, we can predict the price of Infosys on the basis of SENSEX.
Phase 2:
A simple linear regresion model has been created to predicted the day's cloasing price of Infosy's stock based on 10 important parameters which affect the price of any atock. The statistical significance of these 10 prameters were found before fitting the model. Backward Eleimination technique is used to fit the model.
