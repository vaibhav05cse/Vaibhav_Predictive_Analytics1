After collecting all the fetaures, the next process is to identify which are the input features in the data set are how much significant to the dependent variable.
In my case, i have collected the historical values of 10 important features which affect the price of a stock.
In the second phase of my project, i will try to predict the day's closing price of the stock based on these 10 input features.
In round-1, i will build a multiple linear regression model through which i will predict the day's closing price of Infosys's stock.
Before procceding to the training phase, we must find the best features to build a model.
To build a model, there are several methods used. Out of those methods, i prefer the BACKWARD ELIMINATION method.
BACKWARD ELIMINATION is based on the p-value and the signification level(SL) of the variable.
Following are the steps of BACKWARD ELIMINATION:-
	i. Select the signification level; prefer to have a significance level of 5% (SL<=0.05)
	ii. Fit the full model with the entire set of attributes.
	iii. If for any attribute, p>SL (p-value is more than the significance level), then drop this attrubute. and go to step ii.
	iv. Else, FInalize the model.
